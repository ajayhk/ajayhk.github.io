### PROFESSIONAL EXPERIENCE

#### _Principal Engineer at Intel (current)_

Distributed Deep Learning on Intel Nervana AI Training Chip[[1]](#_ftn1)

*       
Expert on Distributed Deep Learning including
scaling, full-stack integration, performance and convergence 

*       
Tech-lead for system software team (10 member) owning
**Distributed Training** incl. arch/design,
code, collective kernels, Hw/Sw co-design, requirements, customer interaction,
projections, roadmap, hiring

*       
Achieved **world-class
scaling performance (95%)** on Data and Model Parallelism (Intel AI DevCon
Keynote[[2]](#_ftn2))

*       
ML Frameworks (TensorFlow, PaddlePaddle), CNNs,

#### _Manager / Senior Staff S/w Engineer at Intel (2012-2016)_

*       
**Promoted to Manager** of system software team. Managed team of 8 software engineers + Product manager for two products that did malware detection (Return Oriented Programming/Stack Buffer Overflow attacks) using Control Flow Integrity (CFI) with Binary Translation (BT). One product used by McAfee for identifying malware and feeding into their virus definitions. Other product protects apps incl. Microsoft Office, Google Chrome, Firefox, Acrobat PDF viewer against many Zero-day attacks (e.g.[[3]](#_ftn3)). Detection
tested on malware in VirusTotal, McAfee DB samples. **Performance overhead of Binary Translation reduced from 3-4x to 10%

*       
Tech lead (software dev/perf improvement) for multiple BT projects incl. Android malware detection, h/w BT. Created Perf Framework for identifying performance bottlenecks and regressions (not possible with tools like Intel VTune). **50% memory reduction and 2x perf speedup**
